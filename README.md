## 📌 About Me
Data Scientist with 3–5+ years’ experience owning end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, from problem definition and exploratory analysis through to production deployment in collaboration with ML Engineers. Strong track record building high-impact models focused on customer behaviour, churn prediction, lifetime value, segmentation, and commercial value modelling. Deep expertise in Python (OOP), Scikit-learn, XGBoost/LightGBM, SQL, feature engineering, and advanced statistical methods, including survival analysis, time-series forecasting, and behavioural modelling. Skilled at breaking down ambiguous business problems, uncovering the drivers behind customer actions, and communicating insights clearly to commercial and product stakeholders. Passionate about building models that materially influence strategy and improve customer retention, engagement, and acquisition efficiency.

## 🧑‍💼 Experience
- **Data Scientist — Specsavers**  
•	Led development of behavioural prediction models including churn, next-purchase probability, and retention uplift, driving personalisation strategies across digital and CRM teams.
•	Built and maintained Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) and propensity models using Python, SQL, and Scikit-learn; results shaped commercial decisions and improved customer targeting efficiency.
•	Owned full ML lifecycle from discovery and data exploration through POC, feature engineering, model design, validation, deployment, and monitoring using Azure ML.
•	Conducted deep-dive analytics to uncover root drivers of churn, revealing behavioural and tariff-level indicators that enabled earlier interventions.
•	Partnered closely with ML Engineers and Data Engineering to deploy models as scalable production services, supporting retraining workflows and API-based scoring.

- **Machine Learning Analyst | Sigma.AI | Apr 2023 – Oct 2023**  
•	Developed Python-based ML models (classification, clustering, NLP) to understand user behaviours and predict engagement.
•	Conducted statistical analysis and exploratory modelling to support product teams in hypothesis validation.
•	Assisted in model calibration, evaluation, and design of structured experimentation frameworks.

- **Analytical Engineer | Dynamon Ltd | Sep 2021 – Apr 2023**  
•	Built forecasting and optimisation models using large-scale datasets, improving customer decision-making tools and operational insights.
•	Owned development and enhancement of analytical data pipelines (Python, SQL, Spark) processing millions of records daily.
•	Produced insights that informed customer lifetime performance, engagement patterns, and optimisation strategies.

- **Data Scientist Intern | RNS | Sep 2020- Sep 2021**  
•	Developed clustering, regression, and classification models to analyse customer actions and campaign performance.
•	Automated feature engineering workflows, improving analytical efficiency and data quality.
•	Communicated insights to marketing and product stakeholders, enabling data-driven changes.
